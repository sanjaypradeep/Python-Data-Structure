# That's one way of doing it for yourself. However, we don't ask questions in competitive programming, we answer them! We will only use raw_input() to read a string without asking any questions to the system.
#
# Task
# Read a string from the console and print it.
#
# Input Format
# The first and only line of input contains a string.
#
# Constraints
# String length ? 500
#
# Output Format
# Print the same string back.
#
# Sample Input
#
# How many chickens does it take to cross the road?
# Sample Output
#
# How many chickens does it take to cross the road?
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
#getInput = raw_input("How many chickens does it take to cross the road?\n")
name = input()
print (name)
