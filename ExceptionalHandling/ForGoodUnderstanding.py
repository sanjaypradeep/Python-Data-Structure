What is Exception?

Errors detected during execution are called exceptions, if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. 

'''

print(1/0) # Syntactically it's right, but do you think this will execute?

# print(name) # have we declared/defined before this line of code?

# What will be the output?

# print('2' + 5) 


# To overcome the above examples, I'm creating method, which handles the exeptions in it. 

# First example

def division():
    try:
        print(1/0)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("why are you trying to divide a natural number with 0?")
    except ValueError:
        print("Value error man..")
    except TimeoutError:
        print("time out error sir..")

division()

# Second example

def showName():
    try:
        print(name)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("why are you trying divide a natural number with 0?")
    except ValueError:
        print("Value error man..")
    except TimeoutError:
        print("time out error sir..")
    except NameError:
        print("You haven't defined any such variable btw")
    # Stlyish way is..
    except (RecursionError,NameError,TypeError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
        print("I catched.")
        print("Unforu.. user has tried this, blah ")
        # logger.log(e.messages)
        pass

showName()

# Third Example

def addValues():
    try:
        print('2' + 'Sanjay' + 1232)
    # except TypeError:
    #     print("I don't support this type.")
    # except Exception:
    #     print("Master guy says, Something went wrong inside the code.")
    #     print("ERROR_CODE_SYMC_PO@$#:5533636")
    except SanjayException:
        print("Something")

addValues()

# Till now, we saw about predefined or system defined exceptions, isn't it?
# Think about writing our own exceptions?

# JFYI

'''
When we are developing a large Python program, it is a good practice to place all the user-defined 
exceptions that our program raises in a separate file. Many standard modules do this. They define their 
exceptions separately as exceptions.py or errors.py (generally but not always).


user-defined exception class can implement everything a normal class can do, but we generally make them simple and concise. 
Most implementations declare a custom base class and derive others exception classes from this base class.
