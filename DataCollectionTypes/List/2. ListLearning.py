# When we talk about storing multiple values in a container-like data structure, the first thing that comes to mind is a list.
#
# You can initialize a list as:
#
# >>> arr = list()
# or simply
# >>> arr = []
# or with a few elements as:
#
# >>> arr = [1,2,3]
# Elements can be accessed easily similar to most programming languages:
#
# >>> print arr[0]
# 1
# >>> print arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]
# 6
# Lists in Python are very versatile. You can add almost anything in a Python list.
#
# In Python, you can create a list of any objects: strings, integers, or even lists. You can even add multiple types in a single list!
#
# Let's look at some of the methods you can use on list.
#
# 1.) append(x)
# Adds a single element ?x??x? to the end of a list.
#
# >>> arr.append(9)
# >>> print arr
# [1, 2, 3, 9]
# 2.) extend(L)
# Merges another list ?L??L? to the end.
#
# >>> arr.extend([10,11])
# >>> print arr
# [1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11]
# 3.) insert(i,x)
# Inserts element ?x??x? at position ?i??i?.
#
# >>> arr.insert(3,7)
# >>> print arr
# [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11]
# 4.) remove(x)
# Removes the first occurrence of element ?x??x?.
#
# >>> arr.remove(10)
# >>> arr
# [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 11]
# 5.) pop()
# Removes the last element of a list. If an argument is passed, that index item is popped out.
#
# >>> temp = arr.pop()
# >>> print temp
# 11
# 6.) index(x)
# Returns the first index of a value in the list. Throws an error if it's not found.
#
# >>> temp = arr.index(3)
# >>> print temp
# 2
# 7.) count(x)
# Counts the number of occurrences of an element ?x??x?.
#
# >>> temp = arr.count(1)
# >>> print temp
# 1
# 8.) sort()
# Sorts the list.
#
# >>> arr.sort()
# >>> print arr
# [1, 2, 3, 7, 9]
# 9.) reverse()
# Reverses the list.
#
# >>> arr.reverse()
# >>> print arr
# [9, 7, 3, 2, 1]
# Task
# Initialize your list (L = []) and follow the NN commands given over NN lines.
#
# Each command will be 11 of the 88 commands given above. The extend(LL) method will not be used. Each command will have its own value(s) separated by a space.
#
# Input Format
#
# The first line contains an integer, NN (the number of commands).
# The NN subsequent lines each contain one of the 88 commands described above.
#
# Sample Input
#
# 12
# insert 0 5
# insert 1 10
# insert 0 6
# print
# remove 6
# append 9
# append 1
# sort
# print
# pop
# reverse
# print
# Sample Output
#
# [6, 5, 10]
# [1, 5, 9, 10]
# [9, 5, 1]

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
T = int(input())

L = []
for t in range(T):
    args = str(input().strip().split(" "))
    print ("args.. ", args)
    if args[0] == "append":
        L.append(int(args[1]))
    elif args[0] == "insert":
        L.insert(int(args[1]), int(args[2]))
    elif args[0] == "remove":
        L.remove(int(args[1]))
    elif args[0] == "pop":
        L.pop()
    elif args[0] == "sort":
        L.sort()
    elif args[0] == "reverse":
        L.reverse()
    elif args[0] == "print":
        print (L)
