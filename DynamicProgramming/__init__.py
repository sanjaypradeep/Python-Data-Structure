Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently. The main idea is to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations, which can significantly improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

Dynamic programming is particularly useful in optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution among many possible ones. It is commonly used in various fields such as operations research, economics, and computer science.

Example:
A classic example of dynamic programming is the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Using dynamic programming, we can store the results of previously computed Fibonacci numbers to avoid redundant calculations.

Here is a simple implementation of the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming in Python:

def fibonacci(n):
    # Create an array to store Fibonacci numbers
    fib = [0] * (n + 1)
    # Base cases
    fib[0] = 0
    fib[1] = 1
    # Compute the Fibonacci numbers in a bottom-up manner
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]
    return fib[n]

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55

In this example, the function `fibonacci` computes the nth Fibonacci number by storing the results of previous computations in an array, thus avoiding redundant calculations and improving efficiency.
